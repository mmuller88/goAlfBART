# Go Alfresco Backup and Recovery Tool
This will be a script for Backup and Recovery ACS Installationen. There is one existing tool written by Tony:

https://github.com/toniblyx/alfresco-backup-and-recovery-tool

But that is strongly outdated. Anyway I plan to reuse lots of stuff from there.

# Test Environment
For tests I do use Docker Compose provided by the Alfresco Docker Installer (https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-docker-installer).

# Ideas
https://github.com/huacnlee/gobackup looks pretty much for what I look for.
